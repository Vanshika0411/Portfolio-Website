# Portfolio-Website
I recently developed a "PORTFOLIO WEBSITE" that showcases my personal and professional profile. The website is structured with five key sections: Home, About, Achievements, Projects, and Contact.
Home: Introduces me and provides a brief overview of my background.
About: Highlights my skills, education, and professional experience, giving visitors a comprehensive understanding of my capabilities.
Achievements: Displays my certifications from various online courses and workshops, providing a detailed view of my accomplishments.
Projects: Features all my completed projects with detailed descriptions and GitHub repository links, allowing visitors to explore the project codes and download them if needed.
Contact: Includes a contact form where users can submit their name, email, message, and any specific issues.
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with added animations and engaging visuals. For the backend, I utilized Python and a MySQL database to handle user messages and manage contact form submissions effectively.
This project allowed me to integrate both frontend and backend technologies while implementing dynamic features and interactive designs, creating a seamless user experience.

Feel free to explore my work, and I'd love to hear your feedback!
